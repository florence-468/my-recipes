  <ol>
    <li>Rehydrate the dried Chilies and bell peppers by soaking them in water overnight or pour hot boiling water over them for about 2 hours
    </li>
    <li>Blend the rehydrated Peppers with the onions, ginger, and about a quarter cup of water and set aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat the Palm oil in a pan on medium heat until the oil is very hot but not bleached.</li>
    <li>Add the sliced onion and let it cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. We want it browned and not black or burnt.</li>
    <li>Stir in the blended peppers and cook for about 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Add the seasoning cubes, crayfish, and salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Leave it to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes; by this time, the color of the pepper would have changed from bright red to dark red. If not, cook for some additional time.</li>
