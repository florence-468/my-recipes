  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cigar cups | 750g long grain parboiled rice</li>
    <li>500mls Tomato Stew</li>
    <li>600 mls Coconut Milk</li>
    <li>Chicken (whole chicken or drumsticks)</li>
    <li>Chilli pepper (to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li>1 medium onions</li>
    <li>3 stock cubes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the tomato stew if you don't have some in the freezer.</li>
    <li>If you will use whole chicken, wash and cut the whole chicken into pieces. Place the pieces in a pot; add water till it just covers the pieces of chicken, add the chopped onions, stock cubes and thyme and start cooking. The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is tastier.
      Cooking till done and add salt to taste. Put the pieces of chicken in a sieve to drain, then fry with vegetable oil. You can also grill it in an oven. This is to give it a golden look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.</li>
    <li>Now is the time to extract the coconut milk. Set the coconut milk aside.</li>
    <li>Parboil the rice, Wash the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.</li>
    <li>Now we need a pot big enough to accommodate the rice till it is done. Bear in mind that the rice will normally rise by at least one quarter of its quantity from the parboiled state to the done state.</li>
    <li>Pour the chicken stock, coconut milk and the tomato stew into the selected pot. Set on the stove to boil. Add the drained parboiled rice, salt and pepper to taste. If necessary, top up with water to bring the water level to the same level as the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li>
  </ol>
