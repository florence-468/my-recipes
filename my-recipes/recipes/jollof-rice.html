  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups of rice</li>
    <li>1kg Chicken/beef</li>
    <li>1000ml of Ground Fresh tomatoes.</li>
    <li>1 Teaspoon Curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Nutmeg powder</li>
    <li>1 medium onions</li>
    <li>300ml vegetable</li>
    <li>salt to taste.</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.

Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</li>
    <li>Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls.

Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.</li>
    <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.</li>
    <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>
    <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.</li>
    <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.

Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.

You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.</li>
    <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried  tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.

Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.</li>
<li>Add the rice.</li>
<li>Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally.</li>
  </ol>
